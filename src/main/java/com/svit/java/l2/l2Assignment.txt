	FizzBuzz (evaluation )
	consider a range of positive integers from 1 to a limit. For each value, print either a string
	or the value based on whether the number is a multiple of 3, 5, both or neither. Determine the string to
	return based on the following rules for an integer i:
	If i is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz.
	If i is a multiple of 3 (but not 5), print Fizz.
	If i is a multiple of 5 (but not 3), print Buzz.
	For all others, print the value of i.
	//================================
	public List<String> fizzBuzz(int n) {
        List<String> ans = new ArrayList<String>();
    for (int num = 1; num <= n; num++) {
        if(num % 15 == 0){
            ans.add("FizzBuzz");
        }
        else if(num % 3 == 0){
            ans.add("Fizz");
        }
        else if(num % 5 == 0){
            ans.add("Buzz");
        }
        else{
            ans.add(Integer.toString(num));
        }
    }
    return ans;
    }

	ZigZag Conversion  (evaluation )
	The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)
	P   A   H   N
	A P L S I I G
	Y   I   R
	And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
	Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:
	string convert(string text, int nRows);
	convert("PAYPALISHIRING", 3) should return "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR".


	Valid Binary Search Trees  
	Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).
	Assume a BST is defined as follows:
	•	The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
	•	The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
	•	Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.


	Reverse a linked list.
	Example
	For linked list 1->2->3, the reversed linked list is 3->2->1

	Merge two given sorted integer array A and B into a new sorted integer array.
	Example
	A=[1,2,3,4]
	B=[2,4,5,6]
	return [1,2,2,3,4,4,5,6]
