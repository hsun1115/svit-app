/**
 * City A has its own sales tax and import tax for all goods/items . 
 * 
 * There are three types of items: 
 *  1. domestic BFM (TYPE_BFM) books, food and medical products
 *  2. imported BFM (TYPE_BFM_IMPORT) 
 *  3. domestic other goods (TYPE_OTHER_GOODS) all goods, except boos, food, and medical products
 *  4. imported other goods (TYPE_OTHER_GOODS_IMPORT) 

 * 
 * local sale tax is 10%, and import tax is 5%. 
 * 
 * Thinking in Java with OOP, design a SALES TAXES solution and shopping cart. 
 * Calculate and print total tax and total price for each input of items 
 * for examples:
 * 
 *  input 1: 
 *  type definition,  category,   quantity,  price	
 *  TYPE_BFM, "book", 1, 12.49
 *	TYPE_OTHER_GOODS, "music CD", 1, 14.99
 *	TYPE_BFM, "chocolate bar", 1, 0.85
 *  
 *  
 *  input 2: 
 *  type definition,  category,   quantity,  price	
 *  TYPE_BFM_IMPORT, "imported box of chocolates", 1, 10.00
 *	TYPE_OTHER_GOODS_IMPORT, "imported bottle of perfume", 1, 47.50
 *  
 *  input 3: 
 *  TYPE_OTHER_GOODS_IMPORT, "imported bottle of perfume", 1, 27.99
 *	TYPE_OTHER_GOODS, "bottle of perfume", 1, 18.99
 * 	TYPE_BFM, "packet of headache pills", 1, 9.75
 * 	TYPE_BFM_IMPORT, "box of imported chocolates", 1, 11.25
 *  
 * 
 * Create a custom exception type if needed
